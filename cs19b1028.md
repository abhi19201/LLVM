# LLVM

## Introduction

LLVM is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. It contains all of the tools and header files needed to process intermediate representations and converts it into more optimized object files. Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and bitcode optimizer. Clang is a compiler front end for C , C++ and many languages. Clang uses LLVM compiler infrastructure as it’s backend. LLVM project includes an implementation of the C++ Standard Library called libc++. In this report we will be focusing on OOPS concepts and interesting C++ features used in the development of Clang which is based on LLVM.

## C++11/C++14 features used

### C++11 features used :

- Non Static data member Initializer (storage variable in any class (_Any.h_))
- Initializer lists
- Static assertions
- auto-typed variables
- Lambda expressions  (LambdaExpr in _ExprCXX.cpp_)
- Unicode string literals
- Default template arguments for function templates
- Strongly-typed enums
- Inheriting constructors
- Inline namespaces
- Range Based for loop
- Minimal support for garbage collection and - reachability-based leak detection
- Atomic operations (_llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/atomic_)
- Thread-local storage

### C++14 features used :

- Tweak to certain C++ contextual conversions
- Binary literals
- Variable templates
- decltype(auto)
- Initialized lambda captures (LambdaCapture in _ExprCXX.cpp_ )
- Return type deduction for normal functions
- Generic Lambdas
- Relaxing requirements on constexpr functions
- Clarifying memory allocation
- Single quotation mark as digit separator
- C++ Sized Deallocation

## Class hierarchy

The core LLVM classes are defined in header files in the _include/llvm/IR directory_, and implemented in the _lib/IR directory_.

For example _Type.h_ is a superclass. Types cannot be instantiated on its own but has to be through its subclasses.

Some of its derived classes are

- IntegerType - Subclass of DerivedType
- SequentialType - Subclass of ArrayType and VectorType
- VectorType - Subclass of SequentialType
- ArrayType - Subclass of SequentialType
- PointerType - Subclass of Type
- StructType - Subclass of DerivedType
- FunctionType - Subclass of DerivedType

## OOP design decisions for LLVM

One of the most important design decisions made in LLVM is Library-based architecture derived from OOP. Library based approach enables developers to change intermediate representation as per the need. Modularity with namespaces is maintained in LLVM. The namespaces represents a good solution to modularize the application, LLVM/clang defines more than 500 namespaces to enforce its modularity, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Usage of namespace __llvm_libc (_TypeTraits.h_)

Operator Overloading (_iterator.h_)

Inheritance, multiple inheritance enables maintaining relationships between different objects. Composition enables reuse of existing code. Template class enables functions and classes to operate with generic types.
Class templating can be seen in _BlotMapVector.h_ class

## Design Pattern

Design pattern can be defined as a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in the software design.

Some Design pattern from LLVM are :

- Factory - It creates an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- Decorator - Adds responsibility to objects dynamically
- Observer - Creates a relationship between one object to many such that when one object is updated others get informed and updated
- Visitor - This defines new operation to a class without a change

## Usage of iterators and their own data structures

- Module::iterator – iterates through functions in the module
- Function::iterator – helps in iterating through basic blocks in the module
- BasicBlock::iterator – iterates through instructions in a block
- inst_iterator – goes through instructions in a function

const_iterator and const_reverse_iterator are used in _Array.h_. Functions such as begin(), end(), empty(), size(), front(), back() and data() are used over these iterators.
